# Payever Technical Assessment Project

Welcome to the Payever Technical Assessment Project! This project demonstrates my skills in building scalable, modular, and efficient microservices using **Nest.js**, **MongoDB**, and **RabbitMQ**. It showcases my ability to design and implement a system that handles invoice generation, report distribution, and message queuing, all while adhering to best practices in software development and DevOps.

This project is a testament to my passion for solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. I hope it reflects my dedication to excellence and my enthusiasm for joining the Payever team.

---

## Project Overview

The project consists of two microservices:

1. **Invoicer Service**: A REST API for creating invoices and a cron job that generates daily reports, emitting them to a RabbitMQ queue.
2. **Report Consumer Service**: A microservice that consumes reports from RabbitMQ and sends them via email.

The system is designed to be **scalable**, **decoupled**, and **easy to maintain**, leveraging modern technologies and tools.

---

## Key Features

- **REST API**: Create and manage invoices via a well-defined API.
- **Cron Job**: Automatically generate and queue reports daily at 12 PM.
- **Message Queuing**: Use RabbitMQ to decouple the invoicer and email microservices.
- **Health Checks**: Monitor the health of the invoicer service to ensure reliability.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Easy-to-run setup using Docker and Docker Compose.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Nest.js (Node.js framework)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **DevOps**: Health checks, multi-stage Docker builds, and environment variable management

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following structure:

payever-assessment/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ payever-invoicer/ # Invoicer service (REST API + cron job)
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ src/ # Source code for the invoicer service
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile # Dockerfile for the invoicer service
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ package.json # Dependencies for the invoicer service
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ report-consumer/ # Report consumer service (email microservice)
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ src/ # Source code for the email microservice
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile # Dockerfile for the email microservice
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ package.json # Dependencies for the email microservice
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ... # Other apps (if any)
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yaml # Docker Compose configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json # Root package.json for the monorepo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/payever-assessment.git
cd payever-assessment

2. Set Up Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your docker-compose.yaml file or in a .env file:

    MongoDB:

        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: Root username for MongoDB.

        MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: Root password for MongoDB.

    RabbitMQ:

        RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: Username for RabbitMQ.

        RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: Password for RabbitMQ.

    Invoicer Service:

        MONGODB_URI: MongoDB connection string.

        RABBITMQ_URL: RabbitMQ connection string.

    Report Consumer Service:

        RABBITMQ_URL: RabbitMQ connection string.

3. Build and Run the Project

Use Docker Compose to build and run the project:
bash
Copy

docker-compose up --build

This will:

    Start MongoDB and RabbitMQ.

    Build and start the invoicer service.

    Build and start the report-consumer service.
